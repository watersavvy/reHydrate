  <h1>5 Details Concerning Bottled Water</h1>
  
  <p>Each bottle requires about three times the quantity of water it holds to produce. Do you know where they go once we are done with them? For roughly every six we use only one will enter a recycling bin. Of the other five, potentially forty percent travel to the ocean.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm046894.htm" target="_blank">FDA does regulate bottled water </a>with stricter rules than the EPA standards for lead and coliform however New York and Massachusetts are the only states that require the source to be presented on each bottle. Roughly forty percent of bottled water is tap water which may be cause for concern depending on where you live. NRDC compiled <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/uscities/execsum.asp" target="_blank">a report</a> about tap water quality in cities. Little has changed since it was published.</p> 

  <p>Even during a drought, companies that mine and sell bottled water continue to draw from places that are quite literally drying up. Read about <a href="http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/03/05/bottling-water-california-drought/24389417/" target="_blank">extraction in the San Bernadino National Forest</a> for example.</p>

  <p>After the universal solvent otherwise know as water has been treated by a process like reverse osmosis that reduces contaminants, it becomes needier in essence seeking out particles nearby grab a hold of. So if a treated batch sits in a truck or our backseat on a hot day for instance, the water is more likely to leach contaminants from inside the bottle. Plastic in our bloodstream may be a hormone disruptor although a regular checkup does not include testing for its presence. How much can our bodies handle? Meet<a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/science/plastic-runs-in-my-family-and-in-yours-too/" target="_blank"> one of the first plastic engineers</a> who retired from the industry after observing health effects.</p>

  <p>Many new homes are being built with advanced microfiltration systems for safer drinking water, the most common being a refrigerator door ice and water dispenser. Look for replacement cartridges that have been tested by a third party verifier like <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/" target="_blank">NSF</a>. If you don't have a system in place and home deliver from a reputalbe source is not an option, grocery stores have stations however they are not always located by beverages.
